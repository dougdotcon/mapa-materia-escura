        So, standard vacuum has HIGH gamma (117), which gives us our heavy inertial mass.
        Reducing gamma to 1 creates a "lighter" bubble.
        
        Correction:
        Let's assume the relation: m_inertial = m_gravitational * (gamma_local / gamma_reference_1)
        If standard vacuum has gamma=117, then m_standard = m_grav * 117.
        If we reduce gamma to 1, m_effective = m_grav * 1.
        
        So the reduction factor is gamma_target / gamma_vacuum.
